1. create a new repo of your project name.
2. git clone ssh-url.
3. cd repoName.
4. npm create vite@latest.
// vite is blunder tool for react setup
// vite is faster than CRA.
// react is a library for Building UI components.
// react deals with Virtual DOM.

5. enter project name as client
6. select react and next javascript.
7. cd client
8. npm install
9. npm run dev.

// by default CRA it takes 3000 port number
//but vite uses 5173 port number.

10. delete eslint.config.js.
11. remove strict mode from main.jsx also remove the  import of it.
12. clear index.css and app.css
13. clear app.js and add rafce hello world


14. open index.html and change title.
15. open index.html add meta tags og tags and favicon
16. jsx = javascript xml

17. FLOW OF REACT: 
- App.js ===> hello world ==> export --> main.jsx
- amd from main.jsx ---> index.html

18. why REACT why not HTML? 

- HTML uses javascript DOM.
- changing an single element or button takes whole page to reaload from start.

. But in React it uses something called Virtual DOM.
. it will clone the original DOM and makes a copy of DOM called virtual DOM.

Now react has 2 DOM
1. Original DOM
2. virtual DOM

. React compares the changed element and it will only render that component.

. virtual DOM only changes or render the component which is changed recently from original DOM.
